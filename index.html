<p class="site-title" style="margin-bottom: 6%; margin-top: 15px; font-family: monospace;">K Game Development Club</p>

<p class="centered subtitle">Purpose</p>

<p>
  A club for game developers from any grade or skill-level. Work together with other members to develop or plan out games, whether that game is the club's or your own personal project. We hope to help develop your skills in whatever field you want to be in (programming, art, 3D modeling, game design, etc.). 
 <br></br>
  We will mainly work with Godot and Roblox Studio* to create video games, big and small, along with modular systems to use as building blocks for future games. In terms of programming/scripting, we will mainly work using Luau and GDScript. However, we are also open to other programming languages and game engines.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
  *Roblox as a platform has many issues with moderation and child safety. 
  This club uses Roblox Studio as an educational resource to learn to create a game and does not condone any actions of 
  the company itself. It is important to be aware of the ethical and moral issues surrounding both Roblox and the game industry 
  as a whole. For those who aren't comfortable with using Roblox-related programs, 
  I recommend using/learning Godot.
