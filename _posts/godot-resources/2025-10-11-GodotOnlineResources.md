As of 2025, Godot has gained a lot of resources and support channels from the community as the engine's popularity grows larger every year. This post will inform you on some online resources you can use to get help.

PS: If you don't know already, Godot has an official documentation page [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/).

## Godot Forum

Godot has an official forum where developers can make posts and comments relating to the engine or projects. It has tags and categories that make it easy to find specific topics when searching. Not only does the forum have a place for developer support, but you can also post showcases, read announcements, and post your *own* resources for other developers. 

## Google / Web Browsing
Just googling a question about something will make it easy to find a lot of problems you face when working in Godot. Usually, search results will contain links to the Godot Forum, stack overflow, or a Reddit post. Although this method of finding answers in convenient, there will be times where the answer you are looking for might not immediately show up.

In this case, don't prematurely give up. There are a few methods you can use to potentially find what you need:
- If a Reddit post (or any kind of social media post) seems to be left unanswered or abandoned, it at least shows that you're problem has been faced before. Therefore, tweaking key words when searching or going through the subreddit the question was asked can make the algorithm more aware of what you're exactly wanting.
- Create your own post asking for help, in which you will likely be given an answer.
- Debug further into the problem your facing to potentially find a root cause or a clearer error which can be used to search for an answer more easily.

Note: It's also important to know that some answers might be **outdated**, and it doesn't work anymore or might be superseeded by another, better answer. So be aware at the dates of the posts you're looking at.

## YouTube
YouTube has a wealth of resources available, in the forms of step-by-step tutorials, project templates, and discussions on certain topics. However, be aware of the pitfalls taken when relying on videos:
- Tutorials can be very helpful, *but* do not just copy and paste any code or methods all willy nilly. It's very important that you try to understand what you're watching and the concepts the video show instead of the hard-written content itself. Instead of copying the code straight up, you should instead naturally write the code into your project, which will not only help you understand but will make it easy to implement any other parts of your game into the system.
- The same goes for templates. I suggest you look at templates and experiment with it rather than using it as a base of your game. They can be really helpful for learning, but you should not rely on them for the game's design and structure.
- Some YouTubers, whether intentionally or not, can be misinformed and spread misinformation. Likely, comments under the video might expose of the problems the video has, and can help you understand any problems the YouTubers themselves are making.

An organized list of recommended YouTube videos can be found [here](/resources/godot/videos).

## Discord Servers
Discord servers can be a great place to have dicussions with other developers on various topics. They usually have support channels for programming, design, physics, UI, etc. You can also make posts here to get answers with problems you may encounter.

[Godot Cafe](https://discord.gg/4JBkykG) is the most popoular community-run server for Godot. Some other servers that could be helpful are [Godot Engine](https://discord.gg/godotengine) (the official Godot server), and [GDQuest](https://discord.gg/Ga5XxW7g5A), a server centered around Godot courses.
